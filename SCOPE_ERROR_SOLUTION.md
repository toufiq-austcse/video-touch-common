# Solution for "Scope not found" Error

## Issue Summary

When attempting to publish the package to npm, you encountered the following error:

```
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@toufiq-austcse%2fvideo-touch-common - Scope not found
npm ERR! 404 
npm ERR! 404  '@toufiq-austcse/video-touch-common@1.0.1' is not in this registry.
```

This error occurs because the scope `@toufiq-austcse` doesn't exist in the npm registry or you don't have access to it.

## Changes Made

To help resolve this issue, I've created two documentation files:

1. **SCOPE_CREATION.md**: Provides detailed instructions on how to:
   - Verify npm authentication
   - Create a scope in the npm registry
   - Publish with the correct scope
   - Use alternative approaches if needed

2. **Updated PUBLISHING.md**: Added information about scoped packages and a reference to the SCOPE_CREATION.md file.

## Recommended Steps

To resolve the "Scope not found" error, follow these steps in order:

1. **Verify your npm authentication**:
   ```bash
   npm whoami
   ```
   If this doesn't show your username, log in:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

2. **Choose one of these options**:

   a. **Change the package scope to match your npm username**:
      - Edit package.json to change `@toufiq-austcse/video-touch-common` to `@your-npm-username/video-touch-common`
      - Run `npm publish --access public`

   b. **Create an npm organization**:
      - Visit https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
      - Create an organization named "toufiq-austcse"
      - Run `npm publish --access public`

   c. **Remove the scope**:
      - Edit package.json to change `@toufiq-austcse/video-touch-common` to `video-touch-common`
      - Run `npm publish`

## Additional Notes

- For scoped packages, the `--access public` flag is required as they are private by default.
- If you choose to remove the scope, be aware that unscoped package names must be unique across the entire npm registry.
- Make sure your npm account email is verified before attempting to publish.
