# Creating a Scope in npm Registry

This document provides instructions for resolving the "Scope not found" error when publishing a scoped package to npm.

## Understanding the Error

The error message you're seeing:
```
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@toufiq-austcse%2fvideo-touch-common - Scope not found
```

This indicates that the scope `@toufiq-austcse` doesn't exist in the npm registry or you don't have access to it.

## Solutions

### 1. Verify npm Authentication

First, make sure you're properly logged in to npm:

```bash
npm whoami
```

If this command doesn't return your username or gives an error, you need to log in:

```bash
npm login
```

Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and email.

### 2. Create the Scope

For scoped packages, the scope must match your npm username or be an organization that you're a member of.

#### Option A: Use Your npm Username as the Scope

If your npm username is different from "toufiq-austcse", you have two options:

1. Change the package name in package.json to match your npm username:

```json
{
  "name": "@your-npm-username/video-touch-common",
  ...
}
```

2. Create an npm organization named "toufiq-austcse" (see Option B).

#### Option B: Create an Organization

If you want to keep the current scope name:

1. Create an npm organization by visiting: https://www.npmjs.com/org/create

2. Enter "toufiq-austcse" as the organization name.

3. Choose the appropriate plan (there's a free tier available).

4. Once the organization is created, you'll be able to publish packages under that scope.

### 3. Publish with the Correct Scope

After ensuring your authentication and scope are correct, try publishing again:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Note: The `--access public` flag is important for scoped packages, as they are private by default.

## Alternative Solution

If you don't want to use a scope, you can remove it from your package name:

1. Update package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "video-touch-common",
  ...
}
```

2. Publish without a scope:

```bash
npm publish
```

However, be aware that unscoped package names must be unique across the entire npm registry, which can be challenging for common names.

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check if the package name is already taken by someone else.
2. Verify that your npm account email is verified.
3. Try clearing the npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
4. Ensure you have the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`
